The château contains sumptuous rococo and Chinoiserie decor painted in the mid-18th century by Christophe Huet."

					This project consists of enhancing the value of the castle of Champs sur Marne, more particularly its greenhouses, by imagining the creation of a modern tea room, in partnership with the assistant of the castle, Catherine Metz.<br>

					This would have a double effect, to increase tourist interest among the population and to promote the technical capacities of the IUT.

					To do so, we had to take into consideration different elements to carry out its realization. We then considered the users’ expectations with the concept of “design thinking” using the agile method and its tools. This allowed us to better understand the needs of the users and to meet them more precisely.

				Indeed, with the initiative “Les cafés du patrimoine”, the greenhouses will be faithfully renovated in order to keep the same architecture as before while modernising them by making them a Tea Salon. <br>
        Their renovation will add a resting place in the castle park which will make this place more attractive.

				The TeaShop will have two main vocations:<br>
				<br>
        The first is to offer visitors something to quench their thirst with a variety of drinks (of varying quality, ranging from good tea to soda) as well as something to fill a small hunger: here we could imagine products ranging from pancakes to sandwiches.<br>
				<br>
				The second is to offer visitors something to rest with chairs, benches and other outdoor furniture: the greenhouses are in fact located in an area of the park that is very flowery in the summer with a large open area.<br>
        In order to put all this in place, two greenhouses could be reworked (as they are well damaged today). One would be used for the storage of products and their preparation. The other would be used as a catering area. Finally the visitors will be able to eat outside.

          The students proposed different ideas to develop the tea room project and to bring in new technologies.
          For example, the installation of a solar panel with a generator to bring electricity to the greenhouses was mentioned.
          In addition, mention was made of integrating tablet computer to allow visitors to order as well as to learn about different things about the castle like the different types of plants in the castle gardenor  the history of the castle and the garden, and to be able to consult the different social networks of the castle. These tablet computer can also allow younger visitors to have access to certain recreative content in order to keep them occupied while they wait for their order.
          All these new technologies will aim to encourage visitors who have simply come for the tea room to push their visit towards a tour of the castle, which would allow them to get to know the Champs-sur-Marne castle better and thus bring more people to the Champs-sur-Marne region.

          In order to bring more visitors to the Champs-sur-Marne castle, various modifications have been considered.
          First of all, the orangery facing the greenhouses could be used as a tourist attraction. For example, it could host exhibitions about the castle's history or maybe historical representations delivered by the Château. In addition, a partnership with the city's music conservatory has been envisaged in order to produce concerts in the orangery.
          The tea room, or greenhouses, would play an important role in this tourist attraction as it would allow visitors to take a break after or before a concert, during an exhibition or after a performance, while offering refreshments and a quiet, cosy atmosphere. The tea room would help to build visitor loyalty to the castle and will lead them to visit it more often.

				The Château de Champs-sur-Marne would not be the first to embrace the voice of a tea room in their outdoor space. The Museum of Romantic Life already integrated it to its cultural site. The fact that this tea shop has its own tab on their website shows that this is not a gadget but an asset to make the site more attractive. In addition, the site shows to the future visitors the menu, as well as the possibility to book a place for a given amount of time in the tea room, promising visitors an enhanced experience. This is the example on which the Château would like to position itself.
